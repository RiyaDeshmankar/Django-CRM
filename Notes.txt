CRUD- we use class based view when implementing CRUD
create view
retrieve view
update view
delete view

Function-Based Views (FBVs):
- Simple and explicit.
- Great for small, straightforward logic.
- Easy to read and debug.
Class-Based Views (CBVs):
- More modular and "reusable"
- Ideal for complex logic or when you want to extend built-in behavior.
- Encourages object-oriented design.
CBV is a class but we write it with- .as_view(), which treat it as a fxn in urls.py
